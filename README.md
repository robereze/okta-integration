# Title

Integration of Amazon Pinpoint with Okta for Multi-factor Authentication (MFA) Utilizing Telephony Inline Hooks

# Introduction

This guide provides a detailed blueprint for integrating Amazon Pinpoint with Okta to effectively implement a multi-factor authentication (MFA) system using telephony inline hooks. This document is tailored for developers, system architects, and IT security professionals involved in deploying multi-factor authentication (MFA) solutions

The integration leverages Okta's telephony inline hooks with Amazon Web Services to manage SMS and voice call functionalities, which are essential for delivering one-time passcodes (OTPs). These OTPs are crucial for both authentication and account recovery processes. This guide will walk you through the setup involving AWS services such as AWS WAF, Amazon API Gateway, Amazon DynamoDB, AWS Lambda and Amazon Pinpoint, which together handle MFA requests via Okta's telephony inline hooks.

Additionally, this documentation highlights the capability to support multiple languages, for a diverse user base. The guide includes a step-by-step deployment section, where you will execute a CloudFormation teamplate that automatically provisions the necessary AWS resources to support these MFA functionalities.

# Solution Overview

The Okta telephony inline hook feature provides the capability to embed custom code within specific Okta workflows, particularly those that involve sending SMS or voice call messages for authentication. This hook can be seamlessly integrated into various Okta processes such as user enrollment, sign-in authentication, and account recovery when a phone number is used as an authenticator. The inline hook works by leveraging an external telephony service provider to dispatch a one-time passcode (OTP) to the individual requesting access. Upon sending the OTP, the service provider can communicate back to Okta with confirmation on whether the OTP delivery was executed successfully or not.

Note: Only one active telephony inline hook is allowed per organization.

**Detailed Workflow:**
<p align="center">
  <img src="img/Architecture.jpg" alt="Architecture Diagram" width="550"/>
</p>

1.	A user initiates sign-in on Okta and is prompted for phone-based authentication. The user chooses to receive the authentication code either via SMS or a voice call.
2.	Okta generates a one-time passcode (OTP) for the user and checks for an active telephony inline hook within the organization's configuration.
3.	Once verified, the telephony inline hook is activated, creating a request for OTP delivery from the external provider.
4. AWS WAF is used to protect the Amazon API Gateway endpoint by applying AWS managed rules to block malicious traffic and enhance security.
5. The request is first received by the Amazon API Gateway, which then invokes a Lambda Authorizer.
6. The Lambda Authorizer uses the @okta/jwt-verifier library to validate OAuth 2.0 JWT tokens from Okta, allowing or denying requests based on token integrity and authorization checks.
7. Upon successful authorization, the Amazon API Gateway invokes another Lambda Function to process the OTP request.
8.	Amazon DynamoDB is utilized to store message data specific to the user's language preference.
9.	If the requested language is identified in DynamoDB, the system sends the OTP delivery request to Amazon Pinpoint, the telephony provider.
10. The user then receives the OTP through their selected method â€” as an SMS text message or a voice call.
11. Okta is informed about the delivery status of the OTP via a response from the external service.
12. All related activities, including the validation process by AWS Lambda, the message delivery by Amazon Pinpoint, and the security events managed by AWS WAF, Amazon DynamoDB, are logged in AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and auditing purposes.

These steps provide a sequential flow of actions from the user's attempt to authenticate to the logging of the transaction, outlining the interaction between Okta, AWS services, and the end-user within the MFA process.

# Deployment Guide 

This section describes the steps required to deploy the Amazon Pinpoint and Okta integration for MFA, from initial setup to full operation.

# Pre-Deployment

Initially, your AWS account will be configured as a Sandbox account within Amazon Pinpoint. To move into a production environment and to increase your SMS and Voice Service spend limits, please follow the detailed steps outlined in the Amazon Pinpoint [User Guide Open Case](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sms-voice/latest/userguide/sandbox.html#channels-voice-manage-sandbox). Transitioning to a production account will enable you to send messages without the sandbox restrictions.

Additionally, when preparing to send messages, you'll need to acquire a dedicated phone number. For specialized requirements like Short Codes, Toll-Free Numbers, or 10DLC Campaign Numbers, refer to the comprehensive instructions provided in the Amazon Pinpoint Phone Numbers [User Guide Phone Numbers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sms-voice/latest/userguide/phone-numbers.html). Keep in mind that carrier considerations such as message throughput, number pooling, carrier filtering policies, compliance with carrier regulations, and delivery rates are crucial factors that can influence your choice of number type and impact the delivery rates and success of your messaging campaigns. It's essential to understand the various throughput limitations, fees, and region-specific regulations associated with different carriers, as well as the need for sender ID registration in certain regions. By taking these carrier considerations into account, you can ensure that your messaging services are both effective and compliant with all relevant guidelines and regulations.

To acquire a long code for testing purposes, please adhere to the instructions in this guide. Ensure that you select 'Voice only' for the Messaging use case and choose 'Long code' as the originator type. This action will immediately allocate a phone number to your account, which will be restricted to voice call functionalities only. [Request Long Code](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sms-voice/latest/userguide/phone-numbers-request.html).
